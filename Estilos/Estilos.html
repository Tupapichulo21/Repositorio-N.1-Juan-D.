    <h1>Conversion, software version 7.0
        Looking at life through the eyes of a tire hub
        Eating seeds as a pastime activity
        The toxicity of our city, of our city
        You, what do you own the world?
        How do you own disorder? Disorder
        Now somewhere between the sacred silence</h1>
    <br>
         
    <h2 id="Serj">More wood for their fires, loud neighbors
        Flashlight reveries caught in the headlights of a truck
        Eating seeds as a pastime activity
        The toxicity of our city, of our city
        You, what do you own the world?
        How do you own disorder? Disorder
        Now somewhere between the sacred silence
        Sacred silence and sleep
        Somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep
        Disorder, disorder, disorder</h2>

    <h1 class="Daron">When I became the sun
        I shone life into the man's hearts
        When I became the sun
        I shone life into the man's hearts</h1>
